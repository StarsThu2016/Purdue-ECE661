# HW04 -- Key Point Matching (Harris/SIFT + NCC/SSD)

## Homework text
hw4.pdf

## My Report
hw4_RanXu.pdf

## Source Code (Requiring Jupyter Notebook to Open and Run)
$ jupyter notebook

Go through all cells in HarrisCD.ipynb. Some results are printed on screen and the others are saved to images. 

$ python2 SIFT.py

Note that re-running the entire source code may take around 10 minutes, and thus please be patient. The output figures in my own test are saved in OutputFigs/.

## To Install Jupyter Notebook in Ubuntu 16.04
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

python3 -m pip install jupyter

## Required Python3 Packages
numpy, matplotlib, PIL, cv2 (with SIFT, SURF enabled)
